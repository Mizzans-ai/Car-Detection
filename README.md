Car Detection Using OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to detect cars in images using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The system processes an image and highlights cars by drawing bounding boxes around them.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to use a pre-trained Haar Cascade model to detect cars in images. It can be extended for traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicle systems, or other vehicle detection applications.

Features
Car Detection: Uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade (haarcascade_car.xml) to identify cars in still images.
Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected cars.
Easy to Use: Simple steps to set up and execute the project.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries:
OpenCV (opencv-python, opencv-python-headless)
NumPy (optional for advanced operations)
Install the required libraries with:

bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless numpy
Dataset
The detection is performed on a single image file. Replace the image_path in the code with the path to your image:

python
Copy code
image_path = "C:/path_to_your_image.jpg"
How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CarDetection.git
cd CarDetection
Open the notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook "Car Detection.ipynb"
Update the image path: Modify the image_path variable to point to your image.

Run the notebook: Execute the cells in sequence to process the image and detect cars.

View Results: The program will display the image with bounding boxes drawn around detected cars.

Model and Approach
Haar Cascade Classifier: The haarcascade_car.xml file is a pre-trained Haar Cascade model designed for vehicle detection. It uses patterns in grayscale images to identify vehicle shapes.
Example Output
When a car is detected, the image will be displayed with bounding boxes around the cars.

(Replace this with your actual output image)

Limitations
Performance depends on image quality and angles of the cars.
Works best for frontal or side-view car images.
Future Enhancements
Extend to detect multiple vehicles in dynamic environments.
Integrate with video feeds for real-time car detection.
Use advanced models like YOLO or SSD for more robust detection.
